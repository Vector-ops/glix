## S.O.S Help Me


Mount Asahi (旭岳, Asahi-dake) is the tallest mountain on the Japanese island of Hokkaido, a part of the Daisetsuzan Volcanic Group. Located in the northern part of the Daisetsuzan National Park, its native Ainu name is Kamui-mintara, which means "the playground of the gods". Asahidake is a popular hiking destination during the summer, and for skiers and snowboarders in the winter.

On the afternoon of July 24th, 1989, on the path from nearby Mount Kurodake to Asahidake, two mountaineers from Tokyo became lost. While going through the climbing route, they deviated down Asahidake and south towards the Chubetsugawa river. The Hokkaido police searched in a helicopter and ended up finding a giant S.O.S. sign. It had been constructed by cutting down and stacking 19 birch trees, each roughly 5 meters long, and three logs high. The two missing people were located about 3km north of the sign and safely rescued.

The Hokkaido police assumed the S.O.S sign had been made by the missing hikers, but when questioned the two claimed to know nothing about it. Assuming there was another, unknown victim, authorities dispatched another helicopter again on the following day to searched the surrounding area. They discovered fragments of human bones, some with traces of animal bites. Several bones were broken, possibly while the individual was still alive.

In a separate area near the S.O.S., police also discovered a hole, just large enough to fit a single human. Inside, they discovered four cassette tapes, a tape recorder, a backpack, a human skull, a tripod, a pair of men's athletic shoes, two cameras, and a notebook. They also discovered the driver's license of Kenji Iwamura, a 25-year-old male office worker who had gone missing on July 10th, 1984. Iwamura had been staying at a lodge and had told the owner that he had planned to hike to Asahidake. While a short hike up, there are two large boulders that look nearly identical and are used as landmarks for those hiking down. One boulder is near a trail that crosses back and leads to a cliff, while the second leads back down to town.When Iwamura had failed to appear for work a week later, his parents asked police to search for him, but they had found no trace.

On one of the recovered tapes, along with music from several anime shows, police discovered a recording of the voice of a young man shouting. It's 2 minutes and 17 seconds long, and the man can be heard to loudly, slowly, and deliberately enunciate each part of the following:

"SOS, help me, I can't move on the cliff, SOS, help me!

The place is where I first met the helicopter.

The Sasa is deep and you can't go up!

Lift me up from here!"

An acquaintance of Iwamura later gave testimony that he had been carrying a recording of anime show theme songs on a tape, and the shoes discovered were the same size and a similar style to a pair Iwamura was known to own. It's uncertain what helicopter the person may have been referring to. The remains were also found in a marsh, not near any cliff, though predatory animals could have moved the remains over time.

The reason for the recording of the 'SOS tape' isn't certain; No other voice can be heard on the tape, and no evidence exists the person on the recording was trying to speak to anyone specifically. Authorities speculated that the person may have preemptively recorded it to play for searchers in case they were unable to speak, or that it was accidentally switched on and recorded while the man was yelling for help. Many have speculated that the man yelling was Iwamura, but when Iwamura's parents were asked about the recording, they said they could not confirm that the man on the recording was their son.

The bones were sent to Asahikawa Medical University and were identified initially of those of a woman 20 to 40 years old. However, there was no record of a missing woman in Asahidake matching that description, and Iwamura was said to have gone alone to the mountain. The identity of the woman and the potential relationship to Iwamura was unknown and caused confusion in the investigation and media coverage. Authorities later revised their assesment, stating they now believe the remains to be those of a male. To date, Iwamura has been missing for 37 years, and is believed by authorities to be deceased, but from what I can find, the remains have never been formally identified as being his.

After the discovery, the Japan Forestry Agency and the Japan Geographical Authority took a look at previous topographic map data used to find aerial photographs, and were able to confirm reflections of the S.O.S sign that show it had been on the mountain since at least September 20th, 1987. It was estimated it would have taken about two days and considerable effort to create such a giant sign. It was speculated that the sign was made by the missing person that the skeleton belonged to, but in the autopsy of the skeleton that was found, who investigators believed was Iwamura, the body was described as thin and weak and that it would have been impossible for him to make the sign on his own, even without the possibility of suffering from broken bones at the time as well. No axe or other chopping tool that would have been used to cut trees down to make the sign has ever been found, nor was Iwamura known to have taken such an object with him on his hike. How the sign was made, and by whom, remains unexplained.
