## Street from Dream

I used to work in music and toured with this band. The guitarist (josh) of the band's best friend (matt) had died a couple years back. He always talked about the kid and he seemed like a great guy. Josh always had this re-occuring dream where Matt was standing on this abandoned street which, supposedly, was metaphorical for purgatory. Josh had all these conversations with Matt in these dreams and because he had overdosed unexpectedly, he felt like his spirit was not able to move on. At the end of the dreams, Matt would take a bulb from the street light on the street they were standing in the middle of. Josh described these dreams in extreme detail and I could pretty much picture what the street looked like.

Fast forward to about 6 months into touring with these guys. They were huge Bright Eyes fans and wanted to stop in Cassadaga, Florida (Bright Eyes' singer wrote an album there and it's a really creepy, spiritual medium place.) It might be worth noting that 6/7 of the people I was with are all atheists. So we drive into Cassadaga around 2 or 3 am and drive around. Suddenly, this big black dog comes in the middle of the road and just stops and looks at us. The guys in this band were weird as fuck and were saying things like "Follow the dog! It's trying to show us something!" And in my mind, I'm just thinking they are all fucking idiots.

We follow this dog for a few blocks, as it was walking pretty slowly. All of the sudden, we turn a street and the dog bolts. We try to speed up but Josh says "Stop the fucking van. This is it." We are all confused and he gets out of the van and looks around. "This is it. This is the street in my dreams." We hang out for about 15 minutes and from the way he described the street, from having houses on the left to a park on the right, it was definitely the street. As we get in the van, a street light goes off and we just drive off. He claims he never had anymore dreams about it, as that was closure on everything.
