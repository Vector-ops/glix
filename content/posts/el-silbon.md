## El Silbon

**Note**: I highly recommend reading [The Whistler](/post/the-whistler) before reading this.

Dude! Read this, please, I shit you not.

In my country (Venezuela) there is a legend about a guy called "El Silbon" (The whistler). A sort of damned soul that warns people of their coming death.

[Wiki article](https://es.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Silbón)

I'm not making this shit up, I'll try to translate parts from the article for you to see if they fit what you experienced:

    The legend is that of a young man who killed his father as a revenge because he had killed his wife and called hed a "whore". After this event, his grandfather had him tied to a pole in the middle of a field and whipped him, had his wounds cleaned with "aguardiente"(drinking alcohol) and released him with two rabid and hungry dogs but before release he cursed him to carry his father's bones for the rest of eternity.

    He has a particular whistling similar to Music Notes CDEFGAB in that order, going up to F and then going low to B. It's said thay when the whistling is heatd closely there is no danger, because he is really far, but when the whistling sounds far he is really close.It's also said that the whistling announces the death of those who hear it. He can be anywhere at any tine. It seems that the only thing that can save the person that hears it from afar is the bark of a dog, because he is afraid of it, also of chili peppers and whips.The soul takes revenge on womanizing men.

    Many inhabitants of Los Llanos speak of seeing him, particularly during summer, season in which the venezuelan savannah sears under the strenght of drought and El Silbon sits in the stumps of trees and gathers dust with his hands. But he is primarily encountered in times of humidity and rain, when the spectre roams hungry for death and avid to punish the drunk, the whoremongers and from time to time an innocent victim. It's said that he sucks on the navel of drunk men when he finds them alone to drink the alcohol that they drank and he rips appart the whoremongers, he takes off the bones and puts them inside the bag in which he carries his dad's remains.

    Some versions say that he looks like a long giant, six meters tall who walks from treetop to treetop, while he emits his terrifying whistling and rattles inside the dusty old bag, the pale bones of his misfortuned father, or as some claim, his multiple victims. Other versions state that he presents as the shade of a tall and slender man with a hat, specially to drunk people.

    It is said that, El Silbon, may appear near a house on some nights, leaving the bag on the floor and counting the bones one by one. If one or more people hear him, nothing will happen, but if no one hears, by dawn a family member will die in his sleep.

    In the Colombian eastern Llanos, where he is called "El Silbador", they believe it's the wandering soul of a party loving womanizer who died in solitude, and people claim that he seeks the company of someone who dares ride horseback late at night. But this kind version is an exception because, also in Colombia, some others say he chases pregnant women, that his whislting penetrates the ear, chills, and that, if someone hears a high pitch tone it omens the death of a woman, while a low pitch tone omens the death of a man. In any case, that woman or man is generally someone known by the one that heard the whistling.

Edit: Finished translating. This gave me chills dude, I'm not one to believe folklore, but your story is way too similar to just ignore it, mainly because you have no way at all to know about this particular legend.

EDIT 2: I just saw the video, and as my countrymen would say: EL COÑO DE SU MADRE! That's the creepiest shit I've ever seen, and I can't believe OP delivered proof.
