## Time Rewind

I'm late to the party, but this has freaked me out forever.

I was a satellite installer and I was driving between two small towns in North Carolina, Statesville and Taylorsville. It's about a 20 minute drive of a perfectly straight 2 lane road with pretty much nothing but trees on either side. It's the middle of the day and I'm driving along listening to Howard Stern on Sirius when all of a sudden I go from wide awake to falling asleep. Meaning, one second I'm normal, and a second later my head is drooping down and eyes closing and what snaps me out of it is my car bounces like I just hit a speed bump, but I'm still in the middle of the road. Howard Stern is still in the same sentence but my GPS signal says it is lost, and then I hear "Recalculating" and when it comes back I realize I am about 12 miles further down the road than I was, and I had missed my turn by 5 miles.

My immediate thought, even though I consider myself a level-headed atheist was that I fell asleep, hit a tree and died, and was now in some weird afterlife. It was such a strong feeling that I drove to the nearest gas station, got out headed inside with a sweaty palms feeling that the cashier inside was not going to be able to see me. To my relief she did, and I bought a Red Bull. I still think I was hypnotized by the road and drove on some weird autopilot for a while, but losing GPS signal, and not missing any of Howard Stern is explainable to me, I even used the Sirius ability to rewind and there was none of the show that I missed.

In case you're wondering my butthole felt fine.
