## My friends brother's doppleganger



At a friends place back in 2008.

When we were all teenagers, we had a cool shed at a friends that we'd hang out in every weekend. It had 4 sets of bunk beds, tables, a fireplace, TV, fridge etc. the whole lot!

One night we were all hanging out in there when I decided I needed a piss. I walked out the front door of the shed and started to walk to the right when I stopped.

Now let me explain the layout here. As you walk out of the shed, his house is to the left and to the right is where we all parked our cars - further out you're left with empty fields and trees.

It was dark by now, the lights from the house illuminating the space between the house and our cars, but trailing off just past them. As I took a step to the right (intending to go behind the cars to relieve myself), I saw my friends older brother standing there.

I watched him for a good 5-10 seconds as he stood there, facing into the darkness. He then proceeded to walk behind a couple trees and a car before he disappeared.

Confused, I walked back into the shed and asked my friend what his brother was doing by the cars. The conversation went as follows:

Me: "Hey man, what's your brother doing by the cars?"

Him: "What do you mean?"

Me: "He just walked off behind the cars."

Brother: "I'm right here."

I looked over and there his brother was, sitting down on one of the chairs with a drink. He was wearing the exact same clothes as I saw him in and the only way to get into the shed was through the door that I was standing in the way of.

To this day, I've no idea how it all happened. I'm guessing I was just seeing things, but the fact that I watched him walk around for a good 10 seconds has always puzzled me. I've never had anything else like that happen.
