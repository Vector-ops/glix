## Ghost Car

Why Am I always so late to these threads? sigh

Hope this gets read:

I was a sophomore in HS at my GF's house watching a movie. It was around 10pm when the flick ended.

I proceed to skateboard home (I only lived like 2 blocks away and it was a pretty quiet sub-urban neighborhood.)

I'm skating down the hill towards a larger street (larger but never really busy, especially not at night) when I reach the intersection I nail a rock. (I had planned on blasting across the street since there were no cars coming either direction)

I fly off the board, skid a good 3 or 4 feet on my head, right shoulder, hip and knee. I rolled to my back and screamed out in agony. The pain was so bad I couldn't really move.

I look up the road and about 30 yards off is a car coming down the way... and where I landed... I was right in it's path. Two lane street. I was right in the middle of his lane. My head was aligned with the wheel.

I tried like hell to move. I screamed. I yelled. I couldn't do ANYTHING!

Car was about 15 yards off. He doesn't see me. Makes no attempt to swerve. 10 yards. I hear him barreling down. I close my eyes. Brace.

Nothing. Open eyes. Look where the car had been. Nothing. Hear the car behind me.

Look where it was supposed to be in the other direction. Tail lights cruising up the road. I hadn't moved. He didn't swerve.

It was like he passed through me... or I passed through him. There isn't really any way he could have passed over me, not with the way I had landed and was positioned in the street. It was a little car.

I can't explain it. I got up, terrified, bloody and baffled. Hobbled home and went to sleep.

No one believed me. But it's fucking true.
